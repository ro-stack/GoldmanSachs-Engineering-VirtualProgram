A virtual experience program run by Goldman Sachs and 'The Forage' to gain insight into an Engineering role.

## Task:
Crack leaked password database

### Deliverables:
- What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
- What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
- What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
- What can you tell about the organizationâ€™s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?
- What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder?
